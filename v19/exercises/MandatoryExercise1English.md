# INF112 Mandatory exercise 1, spring 2019

The goal of this exercise is to practice skills in communication, cooperation and to get familiar with one of the tools used in this course.

This set contains four exercises.

## Exercise 1 - Exercise in communication

Get together in pairs and use five minutes to get familiar. You will then present each other to the group. This presentation should last up to a minute, and you can explain briefly about your partner's background, hobbies, interests etc. If the group is large, the group is divided into two smaller groups that work in parallel. 

## Exercise 2 - Exercise in Communication

Use 10 minutes to make a short presentation (1 Â½ - 2 minutes max) about something you think is cool. This can for example be something professional, school related or something from a hobby. Afterwards you will present this to the group. Remember to keep track of the time and assign one person in the group the to stop the presentations if they exceed the time limit. (A common trick is to start clapping when time is up)

## Exercise 3 - Git and Github

During this course you will in later exercises work in teams with the development of a larger application. For collaboration on larger projects, version control systems help provide a common
storage area for source code and other resources for the project. Such a system also makes it easier to keep track of changes made in files. Git is a popular version control tool, and we use Git in this course to handle source code and documentation for software. Git is implemented in several products. Perhaps you know or have heard bout Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket? For this course, we'll use github, as it's the most popular and widespread of the bunch.

- Go to https://github.com/ and sign up.
- Create a folder for the git project.
- Create a new repository, either via "git init" from the command line (in the folder), or in the browser. If you do that - from github.com, you'll need to clone the repository to your computer so you can work on it.
- Create a text file containing a recipe for waffles. Then upload this file into the repository via the command line. (Useful commands: *"add", "commit", "push"*)

Tip: It is advisable to check out a guide or a cheatsheet. For example, [this](https://medium.com/@nendhruv/essential-git-commands-every-developer-should-know-1249d4d597b5).

## Exercise 4 - FizzBuzz

In this task you will do a "code kata". code katas are small programming tasks (not completely different from [kattis](https://www.kattis.com/)), to be used for coding practice and repetition.

Fizz Buzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 on separate lines, with a few modifications:

- If the number is divisible by three, the program must print "fizz" instead of the number
- If the number is divisible by five, the program must print "buzz" instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by three **and** five, it must print "fizzbuzz".

- This task should be solved with par programming, and this can be done in several ways: If you want to use TDD (Test Driven Development), as shown during lecture, one person can write tests while the other writes implementation code. Or you can program five minutes each.
- It is important that you are careful about **how** you are talking together and that you both have full control of what is happening in the code. Tip: Read [this](https://medium.com/@weblab_tech/pair-programming-guide-a76ca43ff389)

When you are done:

- Spend a few minutes discussing how it worked to program in pairs.
- Make a short summary for the rest of the group (1-2 minutes) where you mention: something you think worked well, something that could have been better and what you could do better next time.

### Further work

- Generalize fizzbuzz so you can choose numbers that fizzbuzz will change and which words to print. Use your own methods.
- [codekata.com](http://codekata.com/) has many good tasks if you want to practice more on code kata.
- If you register as a student in Github, you get [several tools](https://education.github.com/pack) free of charge.
